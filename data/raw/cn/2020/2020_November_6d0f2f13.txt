Infectious diarrhea excludes cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever.
§
Of the 20 reported death cases of rabies, there were 7 reported in November, the others were reported previously.
The number of cases and cause-specific deaths referred to data recorded in National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS) in China, which include both clinically-diagnosed cases and laboratory-confirmed cases. Only reported cases in the 31 provincial-level administrative divisions in the mainland of China are included in the table, whereas data of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macau Special Administrative Region, and Taiwan, China are not included. Monthly statistics were calculated without annual verification, which is usually conducted in February of the next year for de-duplication and verification of reported cases in annual statistics. Therefore, 12-month cases could not be added together directly to calculate the cumulative cases because the individual information might be verified via NNDRS according to information verification or field investigations by local CDCs.
